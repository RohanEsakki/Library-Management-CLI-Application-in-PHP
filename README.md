# Library-Management-CLI-Application-in-PHP
Libaray Management CLI
Develop a software design solution for the Library Management CLI Application. In the course of doing so, you must: 
•	Select and use three language data types, three operators and three expressions.
•	Use correct language syntax for one sequence, one selection and two iteration constructs.
•	Use a modular approach to implement the logic for one object operation 
•	Implement a class that uses arrays of primitive data types twice.
•	Read from and write to one text file
•	Implement two classes that each contain four instance variables
•	Implement one class that contains two options for object construction
•	Implement one class that uses user-defined object aggregation
•	Implement polymorphism once for code extensibility
•	Use at least two data structures according to organisational guidelines
•	Use at least two standard algorithms (one Search and one sort) according to organisational guidelines
•	Demonstrate that you have debugged at least one program using debugging tools provided by an integrated development environment (IDE)
•	Document activities are undertaken in at least one program developed above according to organisational guidelines and coding standards
•	Perform and document two-unit test cases 
•	Alpha tests the program to confirm specifications are met and record the results for tests performed above, according to organisational guidelines.
